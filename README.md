<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Motivation

Fitness is a major part of my life and I particularly enjoy weightlifting. Weightlifting requires consistency and incremental progression in order to achieve physique and strength goals.

On both the Apple App store and Google store, there are little to no mobile apps that cater to tracking fitness progression without charging some sort of premium for a subscription plan. Apps that track your weight, strength progression in various exercises and give users access to personalized workout plans all require periodic payments ranging anywhere from $5-20+ per month.

My goal was to create an app with a simple, modern design that can allow users to easily log workouts and track progress weekly, monthly and even yearly for free. In addition, it was an opportunity to learn mobile development and understand the benefits of state management.

### Design

Influenced by mobile apps like Stronglifts, MyFitnessPal, SmartGym and many other fitness apps currently on the market.

### Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap For Future

### Features to Add

- Display user's name and user's email on 'Account Details' tab on acccount page
- Persist recipe data on recipe page
- Optimize website Accessibility
- Optimize website SEO

### Fixes/Code Maintenance

- Utilze React Context API to refactor and manage state rather than passing state as props
- Update database schema to normalize database, minimizing redundancy and establishing more meaningful relationships between entities
- Incorporate more robust fetch error handling
- Utilize Jest and other testing libraries to automate testing
- Update api routes to adhere standards for api naming conventions
- Store search results in database to minmize calls to Food api (reduce overage charges)
